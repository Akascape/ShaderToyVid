- **Arcade**
- **Customtkinter**
- **OpenCV**
- **Numpy**
- **Chlorophyll**

## Details

This is an *experimental* project based on this [shadertoy feature](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/blob/development/arcade/experimental/shadertoy.py) of [Arcade](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade). 

**You can right click on the open button to import any texture image.**

I have collected some **effect-shaders** from shadertoy.com which you can **download** from here. *(Sources are given within the files)*

*Paste the `My Shaders` folder with ShaderToyVid.*

In some rare cases, you also have to **force quit** the program if the shader window freezes after any complex shader-error.

## Future Development
- Live Editing is unstable and is not implemented. (The demo video was just to show the common effects)
- Any suggestion or pull requests are welcomed.
